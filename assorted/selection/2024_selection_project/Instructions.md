# Wits HPC Selection Project

### This is the 2024 Wits HPC Team Selection Project Overview
Over the last few weeks, we have taught you the basics of HPC. We now want you to put your knowledge to the test by running a compute-intensive task, Bitonic Sort, across a 3-node virtual cluster using OpenHPC.

## Bitonic Sort

The bitonic sort algorithm is based on the concept of a sorting network. It efficiently sorts a given list or array of elements in ascending or descending order. The source code and instructions for building and runnung can be found [here](https://github.com/WitsHPC/HPC-InterestGroup/tree/main/assorted/selection/2024_selection_project/bitonic_sort). Credits to Sayfullah Jumoorty and Muhammed Muaaz Dawood.

## 3-node OpenHPC cluster

This course provides a complete guide on how to set up the virtual 3-node cluster: https://events.chpc.ac.za/event/136/

OpenHPC is an open-source project that provides a comprehensive and pre-configured software stack for high-performance computing (HPC) environments. The course presents a step-by-step guide towards the deployment of a virtual HPC cluster using the community-driven open-source HPC software suite - OpenHPC.

We recommend doing this on your personal computer as it is not easily transferable.

## Tasks:

- Submit your scripts to download, install and run Bitonic Sort.
- Submit your Makefile.
- Submit your run.log.
- Submit screenshot of your 3 nodes running using ```vagrant status```.
